                                   PART 1:            INTRODUCTION
It was our third foray into the dungeons beneath the ancient fortress in the middle of the river. We were on the
second level down from the ruins, standing before the great bronze doors beyond which we believed lay the tomb
of an ancient barbarian chieftain. I hadn't believed the tales of the old drunk at the tavern back at Morgansfort,
but for some reason Apoqulis, the Cleric, believed him. Turned out his stories were true… mostly, anyway.
I held a torch for Barthal, the Thief, as he tried briefly to pick the lock. He turned around and said, "It must be
held by magic. The lock won't even wiggle."
Morningstar, the Elf, smiled. "I have just the thing," she said, drawing from her backpack the scroll we took from
the goblins. She unrolled it and began to read, and though I couldn't understand her words I could see the
characters burning away as she read them, little wisps of smoke as from a candle rising up from each in turn.
Seeing that she was nearly through, I turned my attention to the lock. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but the
little puff of dust that came from it as she finished didn't seem like much. She turned to Barthal and said, "Try
again."
I'm tempted to say that Barthal bent to his work, but he's a Halfling; at just over three feet tall he could look
straight into the lock without stooping a bit. I must have looked impatient, as Apoqulis leaned over to me and
said, "Be still, Darion, he'll be through in a moment or two."
Then I heard a loud click, and Barthal turned to me with a smile. "It's open, my friend. After you!" I handed him
the torch, then stepped to the doors, sword drawn, and Morningstar joined me, likewise ready. I steeled myself
and opened the doors…
Beyond lay a stone sarcophagus, resting atop a raised platform. Strewn about the floor were many human
skeletons. Apoqulis made a sign with his hand that I didn't recognize; then we walked in carefully, trying not to
trip over the bones. I noticed among the bones several bronze swords, covered in verdigris. I stepped to the
sarcophagus. "The lid is likely very heavy," I said. "Come, Morningstar, rather than lift it, let's turn it about so we
can see what treasures lie inside."
Morningstar called "Wait!" but it was too late… I had already laid hands upon the sarcophagus. The bones on the
floor began to rattle, then rose up and assembled themselves in a mockery of life. Without delay they picked up
their swords from the floor and began to attack us. I would have to wait until later to kick myself, I mused, as I
put my back against the sarcophagus and began to fight the monsters…

What is This?
The Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game is a rules-light
game system written with inspiration from early role-
playing game systems. It is intended for those who are
fans of "old-school" game mechanics. Basic Fantasy
RPG is simple enough for children in perhaps second or
third grade to play, yet still has enough depth for adults
as well.

What is a Role-Playing Game?
In the almost 50 years since the first role-playing game
appeared, much has changed. Most people have at
least heard the names of one or two such games, and
many, many people have played. Still, there are those
who have not tried RPGs; if you are one of those
people, this part is for you.
Role-playing games are played by a number of players,
commonly two to eight, and a Game Master, or GM
(often called something else, but the job remains the

Money
Monetary values are usually expressed in gold pieces.
In addition to gold coins, there are coins made of
platinum, silver, electrum (an alloy of gold and silver),
and copper. They are valued as follows:
   1 platinum piece (pp) = 5 gold pieces (gp)
   1 gold piece (gp)     = 10 silver pieces (sp)
   1 electrum piece (ep) = 5 silver pieces (sp)
   1 silver piece (sp)    = 10 copper pieces (cp)
For game purposes, assume that one gold piece weighs
1/20th of a pound, and that ten coins will "fit" in a cubic
inch of storage space (this isn't literally accurate, but
works well enough when applied to a box or chest).
First level characters generally begin the game with 3d6
x 10 gp, though the GM may choose some other
amount.

Equipment
This list represents common adventuring equipment at
average prices. Prices and availability may vary.
Weights are expressed in pounds. Items marked *
weigh very little; ten such items weigh one pound.
Items marked ** have almost no weight and should not

These are weapons used to attack strongholds, or sometimes ships. Their cost may be up to twice as high in a
remote location. A siege engine that throws missiles (a ballista, onager, or trebuchet) must have a trained artillerist
to fire it; this is the character who makes the attack rolls for the weapon. Missile-throwing engines have attack
penalties, detailed below. Note: siege engines are not generally usable against individuals or monsters; the GM
may make exceptions for very large monsters like giants or dragons. Review the rules in the Stronghold section
on page 199 for details regarding attacking fortified buildings such as castles, towers, fortresses, and so on.

Charm Animal               Range:    60'
Cleric 2                   Duration: level+1d4 rounds
This spell allows the caster to charm one or more
animals, in much the same fashion as charm person, at
a rate of 1 hit die per caster level. The caster may
decide which individual animals out of a mixed group
are to be affected first; excess hit dice of effect are
ignored. No saving throw is allowed, either for normal
or giant-sized animals, but creatures of more fantastic
nature (as determined by the GM) are allowed a save
vs. Spells to resist. When the duration expires, the
animals will resume normal activity immediately.
This spell does not grant the caster any special means
of communication with the affected animals; if
combined with speak with animals, this spell becomes
significantly more useful.

The reversed spell, harm, injures the creature touched
so horribly that it is left with only 1d4 hit points. The
caster must succeed at a normal attack roll in this case;
failure means the spell is wasted. Note that, if the
victim has fewer hit points remaining than the number
rolled, they will take at least one point of damage (and
this is the only case in which harm may kill a creature).
Heal and harm normally only affect living creatures. If
applied to an undead creature, the effects are reversed
such that heal becomes harm and vice versa.

Unattended objects are automatically affected when
touched.
The caster controls the levitating subject mentally. If
the caster ceases to control the subject, it remains at its
current altitude until the spell ends, at which point it
falls.
Levitation does not provide any means of horizontal
movement, but neither is the levitated subject fixed in
place. It can be moved by pushing or by towing with a
rope, for example. A creature being levitated can pull
itself along a cliff face or across a ceiling, or pull itself
with a rope fixed to a solid object. Movement of this
sort is usually at half normal walking speed. The
subject cannot, however, change its own altitude.
If a levitating creature attempts to attack with most
weapons it will find that it is unstable. The first such
attack is made at a penalty of -1 on the attack roll, and
this penalty worsens by an additional -1 each round to
a maximum penalty of -5. Should the creature refrain
from making an attack for a full round, it is reduced to
the -1 penalty level on the next round. This does not
usually affect spellcasting while levitated, however.

This spell causes a warhammer made of magical force
to appear, attacking any foe chosen by the Cleric within
range once per round. The weapon moves about as if
wielded by a person of about the caster's stature, but no
such person is present. It deals 1d6 hit points of
damage per strike, +1 point per three caster levels
(maximum of +5). It uses the caster’s normal attack
bonus, striking as a magical weapon, and thus can
inflict damage upon creatures that are only hit by magic
weapons. If the Cleric loses sight of the weapon,
causes it to move out of the spell range, or ceases to
direct it, the hammer disappears. The weapon is
immune to any normal attack, but can be destroyed by
disintegrate, dispel magic, or a rod of cancellation.

Time and Scale
Time in the dungeon is measured in game turns (or just turns), which are approximately 10 minutes long. When
combat begins, the time scale changes to combat rounds, which are approximately 10 seconds long. Thus, there
are 60 combat rounds per game turn. Approximately, because time is not meant to be kept exactly as it is
subjective to the characters.
Distances in the dungeon are measured in feet. Outdoors, change all distance measurements (movement, range,
etc.) to yards (so 100 feet becomes 100 yards) but area of effect measurements (for spells, for instance) normally
remain in feet. Note that the single quote character is used as an abbreviation for feet in some places.

Mercenaries
Mercenaries are hired warriors. They are generally
hired in units as small as platoons: 32 to 48 Fighters,
divided into two to four squads of soldiers; each squad
is led by a corporal, while the platoon is led by a
lieutenant plus a sergeant. Platoons are joined together
into companies, each generally consisting of two to five
platoons and led by a captain with a sergeant as his
assistant (called a first sergeant).
As mercenaries are almost always veteran troops, the
average mercenary is a 1st level Fighter; 10% of
corporals and 50% of sergeants are 2nd level. A
mercenary lieutenant will generally be 2nd level, while a
captain will be 2nd to 4th level and his first sergeant will
be 2nd or 3rd level. Larger mercenary units will usually
be beyond the reach of player characters until they
have reached fairly high levels, and are left to the Game
Master to detail.
Mercenaries will virtually never go into a dungeon, lair,
or ruin, at least until it has been fully cleared. Rather,
they are used in outdoor military engagements; high                 demand better living conditions.) See the Stronghold

I raised my shield to fend off one of the monsters, and hewed at another with my sword, but I missed my first
swing. Morningstar swung at one of the monsters and struck it, but her sword did the bony thing little harm. I
saw that Apoqulis still stood by the door; of Barthal there was no sign. Fortunately, Apoqulis also had a torch.
Apoqulis raised his holy symbol and called in a loud voice, "In the name of Tah, begone!" To my surprise,
several of the monsters turned as if afraid and ran out the door, disappearing into the gloom. Unfortunately this
left quite a few of them still in the room.
Even as I saw all this I continued to hack at the monsters. It took two good blows to down the first one; it
appeared that Morningstar was having similar trouble with the monsters. Then one of the skeletons hit her, just a
minor wound, but still I felt good that I had invested my part of the proceeds of our last excursion in a suit of plate
mail armor; I was shrugging off blows that would have harmed me were I still wearing chain mail.
To my surprise, I saw Apoqulis down one of the monsters in a single blow, then do the same to another in his
very next strike. His mace seemed to be much more effective against the monsters than our swords. As I finally
managed to down a second skeleton, I heard a high-pitched yell… it was Barthal, a little ways down the hallway,
and he was throwing something.
There was a sound of glass breaking, and I felt a splash of water on my face. Several of the skeletons began to
smoke, and then one of them fell in a heap. Holy water, I decided, but I didn't have time to think about it. I just
kept hacking at the skeletons.
By the time they were all gone, I had taken a wound, and Morningstar had taken a second. We had one potion
of healing left of those that Apoqulis' temple had given us; Morningstar told me to drink it, but I could tell she was
in worse shape than I, so I insisted she take it.
Then we turned back to the sarcophagus…

Those who have suffered energy drain generally have a
gaunt, haggard look about them, noticeable by
observant characters.

Healing and Rest
Characters recover 1 hit point of damage every day,
provided that normal sleep is possible. Characters who
choose full bedrest regain an additional hit point each
evening.
Normal characters require 6 hours sleep out of every
24. Subtract from this number of hours the character's
Constitution bonus; so a character with 18 Constitution
needs only 3 hours sleep per night (and a character
with 3 Constitution needs 9 hours). Note that these
figures are minimums; given a choice, most characters
would prefer to sleep two or more hours longer.
Characters who get less than the required amount of
sleep suffer a -1 penalty on all attack rolls and saving
throws (as well as not receiving any hit points of
healing). For each additional night where sufficient
sleep is not received, the penalty becomes one point
worse. Regardless of how long the character has gone
without adequate sleep, the normal amount of sleep
will remove these penalties.

Dopplegangers are weird humanoid creatures who are
able to take on the appearance of nearly any other
humanoid ranging from 3 feet up to 7 feet in height.
They can also read minds (as the spell, mind reading,
but with unlimited duration), an ability that can even be
used to speak any language known to the creature
whose mind is being read. In their natural form (which
few creatures ever see) they are pale and pasty looking,

pounds. Their features look unformed and incomplete.
Dopplegangers wish to live a life of ease, and in pursuit
of that goal they will seek to take the place of any
character they meet who they believe can help them get
that kind of life. This usually means separating the
victim from any allies and quietly killing them. While a
doppleganger can duplicate the appearance of the
clothing and equipment worn by a creature, such items
are part of the creature and cannot, for example, be
laid down or handed to someone. Taking the clothing
and equipment of a victim is thus the preferred tactic.
A doppleganger can mimic the sound of the voice of
any living creature as well as the appearance of any
humanoid. Their mind reading ability will be used to
help them behave like the person they have replaced.

Each dragon can use its breath weapon as many times
per day as it has hit dice, except that dragons of the
lowest age category do not yet have a breath weapon.
The breath may be used no more often than every
other round, and the dragon may use its claws and tail
in the same round. The tail swipe attack may only be
used if there are opponents behind the dragon, while
the claws may be used only on those opponents in
front of the creature. Due to their serpentine necks,
dragons may bite in any direction, even behind them.
The breath weapon of a dragon does 1d8 points of
damage per hit die (so, a 7 hit die dragon does 7d8
points of damage with its breath). Victims may make a

ghoul. However, a humanoid who becomes a ghast in
this way retains all of the knowledge and abilities they
possessed in life, unless those abilities are directly
incompatible with the creature's new form (as decided

adjust XP values to include any such abilities. The

Bone golems are huge four-armed monsters created
from the skeletons of at least two dead humanoids.
Though made of bone, they are not undead and
cannot be turned.
Instead of four one-handed weapons, a bone golem
can be armed with two two-handed weapons, giving 2
attacks per round and a damage figure of 1d10 or by

                                                      These golems resemble statues made of bronze; unlike

                                                      The interior of a bronze golem is molten metal.

                                                      spurts out, spraying the attacker for 2d6 damage. A

Griffons are large carnivorous creatures resembling
lions with the head, foreclaws and wings of eagles.
Average adults (male or female) have a wingspan of
around 22 feet and weigh around 500 pounds.
Griffons nest on high mountaintops, soaring down to
feed on horses, the beast’s preferred prey. Indeed, a
griffon will attack a horse over anything else. They hunt
and travel in flocks, diving low when attacking to swipe
with their claws. They are not above retreating and
then returning when they may be unexpected.
Griffons can be trained as mounts if raised in captivity,
but even in this case they may try to attack horses if any
come within about 120'. Roll a morale check in this
case; if the check is failed, the griffon will try to attack
immediately. A light load for a griffon is up to 400
pounds; a heavy load, up to 900 pounds.

Hobgoblins are, basically, man-sized goblins. They are
better organized than their smaller kin, and are also
better adapted to life in the sun. Their skin tone ranges
from a greenish tan to a grayish brown, and their hair
and eyes are usually dark. Most wear toughened hides
and carry wooden shields for armor. As with most
goblinoids, they have Darkvision with a 30' range.
Tribes of hobgoblins prefer to live in walled villages, or
preferably in castles, and are quite willing to overrun
villages or castles built by other races rather than build
their own. Some tribes do choose to live underground.
Hobgoblins have a well-known hatred of elves, and will
attack them whenever they think they can win.

Jellies are strange creatures made of amorphous
protoplasm. They are similar to tiny single-celled
creatures such as a few wizards may have studied using
magic, but far larger. Jellies are always completely non-
intelligent, and are thus immune to sleep or charm
magic as well as any form or mind reading or
telepathy. Generally they also do not check morale,
but simply move toward any potential meal and attack
automatically.

they suffer a penalty of -1 to all attack rolls. Most
kobolds wear leather armor in combat.
One out of every six kobolds in any group is a warrior
with 1 hit die (25 XP). Kobolds gain a +1 bonus to
their morale if they are led by a warrior. In kobold lairs,
one out of every twelve is a chieftain of 2 hit dice (75
XP) with an armor class of 14 (11) and having a +1
bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or
greater, there will be a kobold king of 3 hit dice (145
XP) who wears chain mail with an armor class of 15
(11) and has a movement rate of 10' and a +1 bonus to
damage. In the lair, kobolds never fail a morale check
as long as the kobold king is alive. In addition, a lair
has a chance equal to 1 on 1d6 of a shaman being
present (or 1-2 on 1d6 if a kobold king is present). A
shaman is equivalent to a 1 hit die warrior kobold
statistically, but has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1. For
XP purposes, treat the shaman as if it has a number of
hit dice equal to its clerical level -1, and assign one
special ability bonus asterisk.
Kobolds are sometimes confused with barklings, for
whom they have a particular hatred; calling a kobold a
barkling or suggesting that the two species are related is
considered a terrible insult.

Leopards are large cats that are 7 to 8 feet long
including tail, and weigh about 175 lb. These cats have
four black spots that form a large circle (rosette). The
center of the circle and around the rosette spots range
from yellow tan to white on the underside. An all-black
leopard is called a panther. The tail has a white tip.
They don’t like to swim as much as jaguars, preferring
instead to climb trees. A leopard will drag prey into a
tree.

The lion is a large cat found in grasslands and
savannas. They have muscular, broad-chested bodies,
short, rounded heads, round ears, and a hairy tuft at
the end of its tail. Adult male lions are larger than
females, and in most varieties have a prominent mane.
They live in social groups called prides consisting of a
few adult males, several related females, and their cubs.
Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying
mostly on large ungulates; any hunting group of 1 or 2
is 80% likely to be females, and any group of 3 or more
almost certainly are. Sometimes male lions are rogues,
living outside a pride, and in those cases they may hunt
as individuals or in pairs.
Lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on
humans. Injured or obviously vulnerable humans may
be too much of a temptation though.

Giant tuataras are large, being 10 to 12 feet long, and
heavily built. They are predators with a powerful
shearing bite. Giant tuataras are more resistant to cold
than most lizards, and are thus sometimes found
hunting deep underground. They are also known to
hibernate in cold weather. Sages argue as to whether
or not they are actually members of the lizard family,
but the giant tuatara does not care about such things.

Common lizard men are tall, generally 6 to 7 feet tall
at adulthood and weighing up to 250 pounds. Males
and females are basically the same size, and it is quite
difficult for other races to tell them apart. Due to their
great Strength they always receive a +1 to damage
done with melee weapons. They wear leather armor
and carry shields in battle.

Weretigers are humans that can transform into tigers.
In human form, they are generally tall, trim, and very
agile. They tend to live and hunt close to human
settlements, and are excellent trackers (5 in 6 chance to
track prey in either form). Weretigers will typically only
attack if provoked. They are capricious and arbitrary to
deal with unless whatever offer is made to them is very
attractive to them.

Mermaids have the upper bodies of women and the
lower bodies of dolphins.     Also called "sirens,"
mermaids often attempt to lure sailors or other men
found near the sea. They accomplish this by means of
their enchanting songs.
A mermaid's song will attract any man within 100 yards,
but generally has no effect on women. Men within the
area of effect must save vs. Spells to resist, or else they
will move toward the mermaid with amorous intent as
directly as possible. If two mermaids are singing, apply
a penalty of -4 to the save; more than two gives no
extra benefit. Affected men will submit to anything the
mermaid desires. When she tires of him, he might be
freed or slain, depending on the mermaid's
temperament.
Contrary to popular belief, mermaids are not fish (nor
even half fish) and do not breathe water. They can
hold their breath for up to an hour of light activity, or
two turns (20 minutes) of strenuous action. However,
being out of water more than two turns (20 minutes)
causes the mermaid 1d4 points of damage per turn.
Mermaids can hear as well as dolphins, and can
produce sounds ranging from the lowest frequency a
normal human woman can produce up to the highest
frequency of a dolphin. This means that mermaids can
learn to communicate with dolphins and whales; at least

Mummies are undead monsters, magically animated
corpses wrapped in burial cloths. They are normally
man-sized, but due to their desiccation one will
normally not weigh more than about 100 pounds.
As they are undead, mummies are immune to sleep,
charm, and hold magic. They can only be injured by
spells, fire, or magical weapons; furthermore, magic
weapons do only half damage, while any sort of fire-
based attack does double damage. Those injured by
mummy attacks will contract mummy rot, a disease
that prevents normal or magical healing; a cure disease
spell must be applied to the victim before they may
again regain hit points.

Orcs are short humanoids (around 5' tall) with solidly-
built bodies. Their upturned noses, wide pointed ears,
and beady eyes give their faces a piglike appearance.
An adult weighs about 200 pounds, and this weight
does not differ much between males and females. Orcs
utilize all manner of weapons and armor scavenged
from battlefields.
Orcs have Darkvision to a range of 60'. They suffer an
attack penalty of -1 in bright sunlight or within the
radius of a spell causing magical light. They speak
their own rough and simple language, but many also
speak some Common or Goblin.
One out of every eight orcs will be a warrior of 2 Hit

they are led by a warrior. In orc lairs, one out of every

These birds are sometimes raised (or hunted) as food.

A rhinoceros (or "rhino") is a member of any of several
species (including numerous supposedly extinct
species) of odd-toed hooved mammals. They are
found primarily in tropical and temperate grasslands.
The woolly rhinoceros is a prehistoric beast with long
fur, found in primitive "lost world" areas in colder
territories. They behave much as the black rhino does.

Skeletons are mindless undead created by an evil
Magic-User or Cleric, generally to guard a tomb or
treasure hoard, or to act as guards for their creator.
They take only ½ damage from edged weapons, and
only a single point from arrows, bolts or sling stones
(plus any magical bonus). As with all undead, they can
be Turned by a Cleric, and are immune to sleep,
charm or hold magic. As they are mindless, no form of
mind reading is of any use against them. Skeletons
never fail morale, and thus always fight until destroyed.

Sea snakes are relatively small; the largest varieties
rarely exceed 6' in length. They have relatively small
heads, and are very stealthy in the water. Their bite
does so little damage that the creature bitten has only a
50% chance to notice the attack, but their poison is
terribly strong, such that any creature bitten must save
vs. Poison at a penalty of -4 or die.
Fortunately, sea snakes rarely attack; only if molested
(grabbed, stepped on, etc.) will they do so. They are
very clumsy when out of the water.

Turtles and tortoises are reptiles with a hard shell into
which the animal can pull its head and legs if
threatened. Turtles will be found in marshes and near
rivers or ponds, while tortoises are terrestrial and
typically found in arid regions. (The specific names
given to these animals are often misleading, as a
tortoise might be called a turtle and vice versa.) The
statistics given above are representative, and can be
used for other species as needed. These animals are
well-camouflaged, gaining surprise on a roll of 1-3 on
1d6 in their natural habitat.

Sperm whales are huge creatures, with males averaging
52 feet long at adulthood while females typically reach
a length of around 36 feet. They are predators, hunting
primarily giant squid. Sperm whales can emit an
invisible focused beam of sound 5' wide up to a 50'
range underwater. This blast of sound disorients target
creatures, leaving them effectively stunned for 1d4
rounds. A stunned character can neither move nor take
action for the indicated duration. No attack roll is
required, but a save vs. Death Ray is allowed to resist.
A sperm whale can emit as many such blasts of sound
as it desires, once per round, instead of biting.

A Zombraire is a free-willed undead Magic-User. Like
the zombie it resembles, a zombraire moves silently, is
very strong, and must be literally hacked to pieces to be
destroyed. However, it does not suffer the initiative
penalty common to ordinary zombies. It takes only half
damage from blunt weapons, and only a single point
from arrows, bolts, and sling stones (plus any magical
bonus). It may be Turned by a Cleric (as a wight), and
is immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells.

"Your idea was good, Darion," said Morningstar after we had turned the sarcophagus lid halfway around. "You
just got in a bit of a hurry to try it."
"Indeed," I said, feeling foolish. I looked into the sarcophagus; lying atop the mummified remains inside I saw a
sword, held in both bony hands with the point toward the corpse's feet. The golden blade was untarnished; the
huge ruby set into the cross-guard shone in the torchlight.
I didn't reach for it, though I found myself sorely tempted. "Barthal," I said, "tell me, is it safe to reach within?"
The Halfling climbed up onto the edge of the platform and leaned over the sarcophagus, peering around within.
"I don't see a trap," he remarked after careful study. "Do you think the dead one, there, will rise up if you touch
his sword?"
"He might," answered Apoqulis, "but I doubt it. The skeletons were likely the only guardians in this tomb."
All eyes seemed to be on me. Reluctantly I reached within, grasping the sword by the blade with my mailed
glove so as to avoid touching the corpse. The long-dead chieftain didn't want to part with his weapon, but after a
bit of twisting I worked it loose.
Shaking bits of desiccated flesh from the hilt, I grasped the weapon properly and held it aloft. It felt good in my
hand… I wondered what magic it might contain?
Barthal's voice shook me out of my contemplation. "Look here!" he said, and I looked down. He had opened a
secret panel in the platform… and as I looked on, gold and silver coins began to spill out. Barthal cried out
gleefully, "Jackpot!"

Magic Weapons
Magic weapons are created with a variety of powers
and will usually aid the wielder in combat. A magical
weapon's bonus is applied to all attack and damage
rolls made with the weapon.
Casts Light on Command: By drawing the weapon
and uttering a command word, the wielder may cause it
to glow; it will then shed light with the same radius as a
light spell. Sheathing or laying down the weapon, or
speaking the command word again, dispels the effect.
This power may be used as often as desired.
Charm Person: This power allows the wielder to cast
charm person once per day by brandishing the
weapon, speaking a command word and gazing at the
target creature. (The wielder's gaze does not have to be
met for the spell to be cast.) The target creature is
allowed saving throws just as described in the spell
description.
Drains Energy: A weapon with this power drains one
life energy level on a hit, as described under Energy
Drain in the Encounter section; up to 2d4 levels can
be drained by a weapon with this power, after which
time the weapon loses this power but retains any other
magical effects or bonuses.
Flames on Command: Upon command, the weapon
will be sheathed in fire. The fire does not harm the
wielder. The effect remains until the command is given
again, or until the weapon is dropped or sheathed.
While it flames, all damage done by the weapon is
treated as fire damage, and an additional +1 bonus (in         Cursed Weapons inflict a penalty to the wielder's attack

We had the foresight to bring several large sacks with us, and we swiftly filled them with coins and gems from
beneath the sarcophagus. Without further delay we moved out, intent upon reaching the stairs to the surface and
then returning to Morgansfort. But it couldn't be that easy…
On the way in, Barthal scouted ahead and we took our time, constantly on the lookout for monsters. On the way
out, we threw caution to the wind, moving at full speed with Barthal watching behind us. So it was that
Morningstar and I turned a corner and practically stepped on the first rank of a goblin patrol!
Once again I was caught flatfooted, but so were the goblins. Morningstar reacted more swiftly, striking down the
first of the little monsters. You might think that parley would have been a better idea, but we had already tried
that with these goblins without success… so I couldn't blame the Elf for striking first and asking questions later.
I raised the golden sword and waded into battle…

                                       Dungeon Encounters
Besides "placed" monsters, dungeons usually contain wandering monsters. The Game Master may create special
wandering monster tables for specific dungeons, or the general wandering monster tables (below) may be used.
In an average dungeon, a wandering monster encounter will occur on a roll of 1 on 1d6; the Game Master should
check once every 3 turns. The circumstances of a specific dungeon may call for higher odds or more frequent (or
possibly less frequent) wandering monster checks.

                                       Wilderness Encounters
The Game Master should check for random encounters in the wilderness about every four hours of game time; this
translates nicely to three night checks and three daytime checks. If your players choose to stand three night
watches, you simply check for each watch (or otherwise do whatever seems best to you); in the daytime, check
morning, afternoon, and evening.

To check for a wilderness encounter, roll 1d6; on a roll of 1, an encounter occurs. If a wilderness encounter is
indicated, roll 2d8 on the appropriate table below. The Game Master should think carefully about how the
encounter happens; check for surprise in advance, and if the monster is not surprised, it may be considered to have
had time to set up an ambush (at the GM's option).

City, Town or Village Encounters
It's important for the Game Master to remember that, unlike dungeon or wilderness environments, cities, towns and
villages are busy places. During the day, most towns will have people on the streets more or less all the time; the
absence of people on the streets is often an indication of something interesting. By night, much of the town will be
dark and quiet, and encounters will be mostly Thieves or other unsavory types; but near popular eating or drinking
establishments, people of all sorts are still likely to be encountered. The GM must make sure that their descriptions
of the town environment make this clear; of course, this will also make it harder for the players to identify "real"
encounters.
The GM is encouraged to create their own encounter
tables for use in each city, town or village created (or
assign encounters by other means if desired); however,
a set of "generic" encounter tables are provided below
for those times when such preparation has not been
completed. Roll 2d6 on the table below to determine
what sort of encounter occurs; a description of each
type of encounter appears below the table.

Judging Wishes
Wishes are one of the most potentially unbalancing
things in the game. With a carefully worded wish, a
player character can make sweeping, dramatic changes
in the game world, possibly even rewriting history.
Before allowing the player characters in your game
access to even one wish, think about how you will deal
with it.
Wishes are granted by a variety of beings. Even when
a wish comes from a device (a ring or a sword, for
instance), some extradimensional being, god or devil or
whatever, has placed that wish in the device. A wish
will tend to further the goals of the granting being; if the
granter is an evil efreeti, for instance, it will attempt to
twist the meaning or intent of the wish so that it does
not really accomplish what the player character wants.
On the other hand, if the granter is one of the good
powers, it will grant the wish as intended so long as the
player character isn't being greedy or spiteful.               In general, a wish is granted with at least literal

"Save or Die" Poison
Poisons, as described in the Encounter and Monster
sections, kill characters instantly. Game Masters may
find this makes the mortality rate of player characters a
bit too high. On the other hand, poisons should be
scary. Here's an optional rule which makes things a bit
easier without entirely removing the fear from poison:
Where a "save or die" poison is indicated, the victim
must make a save vs. Poison or suffer 1d6 points of
damage per round for 6 rounds, starting the round
following the exposure to the poison; this is an average
of 21 points of damage, but even a first level character
might survive with a combination of luck and healing
magic. The GM may create poisons which vary from
these figures, of course. If the Negative Hit Points
optional rule is being used, it is suggested to increase
the poison duration to 10 rounds (an average 35
points).

Magic Item Research
Any character who wishes to create magical items must
know all (if any) spells to be imbued in the item. Items
that produce effects not matching any known spell may
require additional research (to devise the unknown
spell) if the GM so desires.
Some magic items require one or more special
components that cannot usually be bought. Special
components can only be used once on such a project.
For example, the GM might require the skin of a
deceiver to create a Cloak of Deception, or mountain
dragon saliva to create a Wand of Fireballs. Note that
there are specific rules for components under Other
Magic Items, below.
Special component requirements are entirely at the
option of the Game Master, and are usually employed
to slow the creation of powerful magic items that might
tend to unbalance the campaign. It's also a way to lead
the spellcaster (and their party) to new adventures.

The assistance of an alchemist (found in the Specialists
section on page 47) adds 15% to the chance of success
of a Magic-User or Cleric creating a potion.

Permanent Magic Items
Creating permanent magic items (rings, weapons,
wands, staves, and most miscellaneous magic items)
requires a Magic-User or Cleric of the 9th level or higher.
When enchanting an item with multiple abilities, each
ability of the item requires a separate roll for success;
the first failed roll ends the enchantment process. Such
an item will still perform the powers or effects already
successfully enchanted into it, but no further
enchantment is possible.
Permanent magic items, including weapons (described
in detail below), must be created from high-quality
items.    The cost of such items will generally be ten
times the normal cost for such an item.                       Creates a spell or spell-like effect: This is the basic
