# Phase 7: Validation and Polish

## Objective

Validate cross-file consistency, clean extraction artifacts, and finalize documentation.

## Tasks

- [x] Run cross-reference validation checks.
- [x] Perform spell-check and text cleanup for extraction artifacts.
- [x] Enforce consistent formatting and normalization.
- [x] Generate `data/README.md` with schema and file descriptions.

## Validation Scope

- Spell lists reference only existing spells.
- Encounter table monsters reference existing monster entries.
- Table-driven references resolve correctly across output files.
- Remaining warnings are documented and triaged.

## Deliverables

- Validation report with unresolved issues and severity.
- Cleaned data files with consistent formatting.
- `data/README.md` documenting schema and usage.

## Exit Criteria

- [x] No unresolved critical cross-reference failures.
- [x] Non-critical warnings are documented with follow-up notes.
- [x] Data set is ready for downstream app/VTT usage.
